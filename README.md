SimBabe 2 png extractor

after beating the game I looked at the game files and I noticed that the win image is missing,<br>
so I started looking into the bin files of the game,<br>
and I noticed that they have pngs in them,<br>
so I wrote a simple script to extract them,<br>
if you wanted them you are welcome.

I have no clue if this works on SimBabe 1 I have not tried it since I have not finished that game yet.
